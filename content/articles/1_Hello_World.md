Summary: My first post which gives a brief introduction to me and how I will be using this website.



**Hello world, nice to meet you.** My name is Daniel and this is my very first post
to my webpage. I hope this will be the first of many and not my last.
My intention for this website is to be a kind of online portfolio and blog
(coming soon). I intend to use this site as a
way to document projects that I am working on, so it will be fairly well
centred on data science, programming and statistics. However, I may go off on
tangents at times to dribble some nonsense about something else that interests
me.

Anyway, a bit about me. I am an aspiring data analyst/engineer/scientist and
recovering theoretical physicist based in
[Adelaide, Australia](https://southaustralia.com/places-to-go/adelaide) who is
interested in data science, programming, machine learning, deep learning and
most things technology related.

My education and career started in physics and now I am transitioning to data
science. It has quickly become a
passion of mine. Over the past year I've been increasing my repertoire of
skills in this field, in doing so I have learnt a lot and enjoyed every minute
of it. I know I still have much to learn, but I am very excited about the
journey ahead. Now, I am actively looking for a full time data analyst position.


P.S. Documenting this is kind of stuff online is all very new to me and it feels a little *awkward*. Furthermore, it is very likely that I will be fiddling with the layout and the way this site looks
from time to time. Hopefully, it won't irritate the one or two people who
actually look at it.
