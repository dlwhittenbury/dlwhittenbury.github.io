to my webpage. I hope this will be the first of many and not my last.
My intention for this website is to be a kind of online portfolio and blog
(coming soon). I intend to use this site as a
way to document projects that I am working on, so it will be fairly well
centred on data science, programming and statistics. However, I may go off on
tangents at times to dribble some nonsense about something else that interests&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a bit about me. I am an aspiring data analyst/engineer/scientist and
recovering theoretical physicist based in
&lt;a href="https://southaustralia.com/places-to-go/adelaide"&gt;Adelaide, Australia&lt;/a&gt; who is
interested in data science, programming, machine learning, deep learning and
most things technology&amp;nbsp;related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My education and career started in physics and now I am transitioning to data
science. It has quickly become a
passion of mine. Over the past year I&amp;#8217;ve been increasing my repertoire of
skills in this field, in doing so I have learnt a lot and enjoyed every minute
of it. I know I still have much to learn, but I am very excited about the
journey ahead. Now, I am actively looking for a full time data analyst&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; Documenting this is kind of stuff online is all very new to me and it feels a little &lt;em&gt;awkward&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore, it is very likely that I will be fiddling with the layout and the way this site looks
from time to time. Hopefully, it won&amp;#8217;t irritate the one or two people who
actually look at&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Introduction"></category><category term="Daniel"></category></entry></feed>
