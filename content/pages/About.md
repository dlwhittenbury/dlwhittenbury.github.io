Hello world, my name is Daniel and this is my personal website, online portfolio
and blog (coming soon). I intend to use this site as an online portfolio and a
way to document projects that I am working on, so it will be fairly well
centred on data science, programming and statistics. However, I may go off on
tangents at times to dribble some nonsense about something else that interests
me. Anyway, a bit about me. I am an aspiring data analyst/engineer/scientist and
recovering theoretical physicist based in
[Adelaide, Australia](https://southaustralia.com/places-to-go/adelaide) who is
interested in data science, programming, machine learning, deep learning and
most things technology related.

I was born and educated in South Australia. My education and career started in
physics and now I am transitioning to data science. It has quickly become a
passion of mine. Over the past year I've been increasing my repertoire of
skills in this field, in doing so I have learnt a lot and enjoyed every minute
of it. I know I still have much to learn, but I am very excited about the
journey ahead. Now, I am actively looking for a full time data analyst position.

I obtained my PhD in theoretical physics and astrophysics from the University of
Adelaide (UoA) at the very end of 2015 (conferred on the 31st of December 2015). My dissertation
research focussed on a topic at the border of nuclear structure and nuclear
astrophysics. The underlying theme of which was an investigation of the equation
of state of strongly interacting matter and the modelling of cold neutron stars.
I also hold a Bachelor of Science from Flinders University,
a Graduate Diploma of Mathematical Science (UoA) and a Master of Science in
theoretical physics (UoA). Most recently I was a post-doctoral
researcher in the Physics department at UoA working on the project “Eﬃcient generation and evolution of discrete probability density maps”. This 3 year project was funded by the DST Group and was focussed on image compression and object tracking. I am the lead author of two DST Group technical reports which have been made publicly available as apart of this project and also several papers based on my PhD research.

Through my education and research projects I have developed sound mathematical and computational skills. In fact, I have been programming for quite sometime (starting around ~2001). I regularly program in several
languages such as Fortran, Matlab, Mathematica, C/C++, and more recently **python** and **SQL**. During my studies and further academic work I’ve also been able to demonstrate a capacity to work independently and to collaborate with people at varying levels. I have also demonstrated an ability to communicate eﬀectively with external collaborators.


P.S. Documenting this is kind of stuff online is all very new to me and it feels a little *awkward*. Furthermore, it is very likely that I will be fiddling with the layout and the way this site looks
from time to time. Hopefully, it won't irritate the one or two people who
actually look at it.
